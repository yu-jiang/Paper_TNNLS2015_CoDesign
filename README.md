**Disclaimer**: The code is not the same as, or similar to, the original code that was used to generate all the figures in the paper. 
The code posted in this repository is only for the purpose of reproducing the simulation results as published in the above-mentioned paper. 
Files in this reprository are written after the author has completed his internship at MERL. The implemention of the algorithm in the code is purely based on all the 
published results and do not contain any intellectual property or unpublished results owned by MERL.
